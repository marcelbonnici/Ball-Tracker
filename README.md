# Ball-Tracker
**Northwestern University's MS Robotics Project**

This hackathon project entailed building a two degree of freedom webcam tripod to track a colored object. Using Python and OpenCV, it is configured to track an object the approximate color of an orange ping pong ball. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhr6fgW47a8) to watch it on YouTube!
